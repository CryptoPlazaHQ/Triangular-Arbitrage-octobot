✦ You are absolutely right. My apologies. I misread the filename. That is an inexcusable error, and I will be
  more attentive.

  I will now read the correct file: frd.md.
 ╭─────────────────────╮

✦ Thank you for the clarification and for providing the correct document. I have now read the "Inter-Step Profit
  Visualization" FRD thoroughly. This is an excellent and very detailed plan. I understand the goal is to provide
  traders with a granular, step-by-step visualization of how the profit in an arbitrage opportunity accumulates.

  This is a significant feature, and I will approach it with the care it deserves. Given the complexity and the
  phased implementation suggested in the document, I will tackle Phase 1 and a simplified version of Phase 2
  first. This will provide the core functionality and a basic visual representation.

  Here is my immediate plan:

  Plan for Initial Implementation (Phase 1 & 2a)

   1. Core Logic Modification (`detector.py`):
       * The current detector.py returns the final opportunities and profit. I need to modify the core
         run_detection function (or a function it calls) to calculate and return the profit at each step of the
         arbitrage sequence. This is the most critical and delicate part of the implementation. I will need to
         carefully read detector.py to find the right place to inject this logic without breaking the existing
         calculations.

   2. Data Structure Integration (`dashboard.py`):
       * I will modify the find_arbitrage_opportunities function in dashboard.py to receive this new, detailed
         profit progression data.
       * The data will be passed to the display_trade_sequence function.

   3. UI Implementation (`dashboard.py`):
       * Inside display_trade_sequence, for each step, I will:
           * Display the incremental profit for that specific step (e.g., +0.12%).
           * Display the cumulative profit up to that step.
       * I will implement a basic visual indicator using CSS and HTML within the st.markdown call, following the
         layout specified in the FRD:

   1         [Step N] ──▶  [+X.XX%] ──▶  [Step N+1]
   2                  ╰─[Cumulative: X.XX%]─╯
          For this initial version, the connectors (──▶) will be static text/emojis to ensure functionality
  before adding complex animations.

   4. Database Extension (Deferred):
       * The FRD mentions extending the database schema. I will defer this part for now to focus on the
         calculation and UI first. Storing the step-by-step profit is a great idea for historical analysis but is
         not required to display it in real-time. This aligns with a phased rollout.

   5. Advanced Interactivity (Deferred):
       * Animations, hover effects, and the mini-chart will be deferred to a later phase, as outlined in the FRD.

  My first step is to analyze triangular_arbitrage/detector.py to understand the arbitrage calculation logic.
  This is essential for implementing the cumulative profit calculation correctly.

✦ I have carefully analyzed detector.py. The core logic for finding arbitrage opportunities resides in the
  get_best_opportunity function.

  This function iterates through all possible cycles in a graph of currencies. For each cycle, it calculates
  the potential profit by multiplying the prices of the tickers in sequence. It keeps track of the cycle with
  the highest profit (best_profit).

  To implement the feature, I need to capture the profit at each step of the winning cycle.

  Here is my refined plan:

   1. Modify `get_best_opportunity` in `detector.py`:
       * Inside the for cycle in nx.simple_cycles(graph): loop, where the profit is calculated, I will create two
         new lists: step_profits and cumulative_profits.
       * As the loop calculates the overall profit (profit *= ticker.last_price), I will record the incremental
         profit of that step and the running total.
       * When a new best_cycle is found, I will also store the corresponding step_profits and cumulative_profits
         lists.
       * The function will be updated to return not just the best_cycle and best_profit, but also the
         best_cycle_step_profits and best_cycle_cumulative_profits.

   2. Update the Function Call Chain:
       * I will update run_detection to receive these new values from get_best_opportunity and return them.
       * I will update find_arbitrage_opportunities in dashboard.py to receive and return this detailed profit
         data.

   3. Update the UI in `dashboard.py`:
       * The display_trade_sequence function will be updated to accept the new profit lists.
       * I will modify the HTML layout within the function to display the incremental and cumulative profit for
         each step, as specified in the FRD. I will use a simple text-based representation for the visual
         connectors (──▶) for now.

  This approach is surgical. It adds the required logic directly where the profit is calculated and passes the
  new data up to the UI without disturbing the existing arbitrage detection mechanism.

  I will now proceed with modifying detector.py.
